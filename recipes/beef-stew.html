    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A stew is a combination of solid food ingredients that have been cooked in liquid and served in the resultant
      gravy. Ingredients can include any combination of vegetables and may include meat, especially tougher meats
      suitable for slow-cooking, such as beef, pork, venison, rabbit, lamb, poultry, sausages, and seafood. While water
      can be used as the stew-cooking liquid, stock is also common. A small amount of red wine or other alcohol is
      sometimes added for flavour. Seasonings and flavourings may also be added. Stews are typically cooked at a
      relatively low temperature (simmered, not boiled), allowing flavours to mingle.
